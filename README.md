# Shadow-Boy
Demo of a Cyberpunk videogame 

A small demo of a turn based fighting videogame. 

Currently, alpha version. 

To install:

1) Download the .exe to a folder.
2) Download all the files contained in the repository, and put them in the same folder as the .exe (these are the assets required to run the game)
3) Run the .exe 

Notes:

The game doesn't have an IA just yet, so you just move and kill your opponent.

There are a lot of planned futures, but for now this is a test-bed for fun. 

You can also run it from main.py if you like it so.
